          A rainy day is nature perfect backdrop for love, transforming a grey,
          gloomy sky into an intimate, cozy sanctuary for two. The gentle,
          rhythmic tapping of rain against the windowpane acts like a soothing
          lullaby, encouraging couples to slow down, put away their busy lives,

          closeness and quiet joy.
