      Mama, just killed a man
      Put a gun against his head
      Pulled my trigger, now he's dead

      Mama, life had just begun
      But now I've gone and thrown it all away

      Mama, ooh
      Didn't mean to make you cry
      If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
      Carry on, carry on

      As if nothing really matters
      Too late, my time has come
      Sends shivers down my spine
      Body's aching all the time
      Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
      Gotta leave you all
      behind and face the truth

      Mama, ooh
      I don't want to die
      I sometimes wish I'd

      never been born at all
